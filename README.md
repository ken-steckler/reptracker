iOS Exercise Rep Counting App
<img src="img/reptracker_1.png">

## Overview
I created a simple rep tracking app to keep track of my reps so that I don't lose track. SwiftUI was used to make the app
and it consists of only two buttons: increment and reset. Modifiers were included inside the buttons so that the entirety of
the button can be clicked, rather than just the text. Honestly, I just needed something to count my reps, nothing complicated.
